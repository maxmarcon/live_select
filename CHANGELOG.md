* DaisyUI 5 compatibility - active options now include both `active` and `menu-active` classes for compatibility with DaisyUI 3, 4, and 5
* Add `keep_options_on_select` flag. By default, when not in `quick_tags` mode, input text field and list of selectable options are now cleared after selection. This flag suppresses this behavior

Bugfix: fix error when using atom form

## 1.0.0 (2023-02-15)

This version introduces the following breaking changes and new features:

* Rendering using a function component `<.live_select />` instead of the old function style (`<%= live_select ... %>`)
* Dropping the message-based update cycle (which used `handle_info/2`) in favour of an event-based update cycle (which uses `handle_event/3`). This makes it much easier
and more intuitive to use LiveSelect from another LiveComponent.
* Ability to customize the default rendering of dropdown entries and tags using the `:option` and `:tag` slots 

** How to upgrade from version 0.x.x: **

1. Instead of rendering LiveSelect in this way: `<%= live_select form, field, mode: :tags %>`, render it in this way: `<.live_select form={form} field={field} mode={:tags} />`
2. Don't forget to add `phx-target={@myself}` if you're using LiveSelect from another LiveComponent
3. Turn your `handle_info/2` implementations into `handle_event/3`:

Turn this:

```elixir
def handle_info(%ChangeMsg{} = change_msg, socket) do
     options = retrieve_options(change_msg.text)
    
     send_update(LiveSelect.Component, id: change_msg.id, options: options)
    
     {:noreply, socket}
end
```

into:

```elixir
def handle_event("live_select_change", %{"text" => text, "id" => live_select_id}, socket) do
    options = retrieve_options(text)
    
    send_update(LiveSelect.Component, id: live_select_id, options: options)
    
    {:noreply, socket}
end
```

4. If you're rendering LiveSelect in a LiveComponent, you can now place your `handle_event/3` callback in the LiveComponent, there's no need to put the update logic in the view anymore

## 0.4.1 (2023-02-07)
