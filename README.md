Dynamic (multi)selection field for LiveView.

`LiveSelect` is a LiveView component that implements a dynamic selection field with a dropdown. The content of the
dropdown is filled dynamically by your LiveView as a reaction to user's input. This allows you to easily create an
interface for features such as search. Its features include:

* Single as well as multiple selection
* Options to configure the behaviour, such as minimum number of entered characters that trigger an update or the maximum number of selectable options
* Default styles for daisyUI and tailwindcss, which are fully customizable and can be even completely overriden if needed
* Ability to fully customize the rendered HTML for dropdown entries and tags using slots.

### [Try it in the showcase app](https://live-select.fly.dev/) üî¨

### Single selection (single mode)

### Multiple selection (tags mode)

## Usage üß≠

_Template:_

```elixir
  <.form for={@changeset} :let={f} phx-change="change">
    <.live_select form={f} field={:city_search} /> 
  </.form>
```

**NOTE:** add `phx-target={@myself}` if your form is implemented in a LiveComponent:
    
```elixir
  <.live_select form={f} field={:city_search} phx-target={@myself} />
```

_In the LiveView or LiveComponent that's the target of your form events:_

  ```elixir
  import LiveSelect

  @impl true
  def handle_event("live_select_change", %{"text" => text, "id" => live_select_id}, socket) do 
    cities = City.search(text)
    # cities = [ 
    # {"New York City", [-74.00597,40.71427]}, 
    # {"New Kingston", [-76.78319,18.00747]}, 
    # ... 
    # ]

    send_update(LiveSelect.Component, id: live_select_id, options: cities)
    
    {:noreply, socket}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_event(
        "change",
        %{"my_form" => %{"city_search_text_input" => city_name, "city_search" => city_coords}},
        socket
      ) do
    IO.puts("You selected city #{city_name} located at: #{city_coords}")

    {:noreply, socket}
  end  
  ```

Refer to the [module documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/live_select/LiveSelect.html) for the nitty-gritty details.

## Installation üì¶

To install, add this to your dependencies:

```elixir
[
    {:live_select, "~> 1.0"}
]
```

## Javascript hooks ü™ù

`LiveSelect` relies on Javascript hooks to work. You need to add `LiveSelect`'s hooks to your live socket.
`LiveSelect` distributes its Javascript code (a single file) in the same way as LiveView, by including an
npm package as part of its hex package.

To include `LiveSelect`'s hooks, add this to your `app.js` file:

```javascript
import live_select from "live_select"

// if you don't have any other hooks:
let liveSocket = new LiveSocket("/live", Socket, {params: {_csrf_token: csrfToken}, hooks: live_select})

// if you have other hooks:
const hooks = {
    MyHook: {
        // ...
    },
    LiveSelect: live_select.LiveSelect
}
let liveSocket = new LiveSocket("/live", Socket, {params: {_csrf_token: csrfToken}, hooks})
```

### If you're using Webpack or another NPM-based builder

If you're using an npm-based builder such as Webpack, you will need to add `LiveSelect` to the list of your dependencies in your `package.json` (just as you did with LiveView):

```js
{
  "dependencies": {
    "phoenix": "file:../deps/phoenix",
    "phoenix_html": "file:../deps/phoenix_html",
    "phoenix_live_view": "file:../deps/phoenix_live_view",
    "live_select":  "file:../deps/live_select" // <-- add this line, and add an extra "../" if you're in an umbrella app
  }
}
```

And then run `npm install` from your `assets` folder. You will also need to run `npm install --force live_select`
whenever you update the `LiveSelect` hex package in order to get the latest JS code.

## Tailwind configuration üé®

`LiveSelect` supports 3 styling modes:

* `tailwind`: uses standard tailwind utility classes (the default)
* `daisyui`: uses [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) classes.
* `none`: no styling at all.

The choice of style is controlled by the `style` option
in [live_select/1](https://hexdocs.pm/live_select/LiveSelect.html#live_select/1).
`tailwind` and `daisyui` styles come with sensible defaults which can be selectively extended or completely overridden.

If you're using `tailwind` or `daisyui` styles, you need to add one of the following lines to the `content` section in
your `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    content: [
        //...
        '../deps/live_select/lib/live_select/component.*ex', // <-- for a standalone app
        '../../../deps/live_select/lib/live_select/component.*ex' // <-- for an umbrella app
    ]
    //..
}
```

Notice the different paths for a standalone or umbrella app.

Refer to the [Styling section](https://hexdocs.pm/live_select/styling.html) for further details.

## Showcase app üé™

The repository includes a showcase app that you can use to experiment with the different options and parameters
for `LiveSelect`.
The showcase app is available [here](https://live-select.fly.dev/).

To start the showcase app locally, simply run:

```
mix setup
PORT=4001 mix phx.server
```

from within the cloned repository. The app will be available at http://localhost:4001. The showcase app allows you to
quickly experiment with options and styles, providing an easy way to fine tune your `LiveSelect` component. The app also
shows the messages and events that your `LiveView` receives. For each event or message, the app shows the function head
of the callback that your LiveView needs to implement in order to handle the event.

## Contribute ü§ù

Contributions are very welcome! 

Use `mix test` to run the entire test suite, which is subdivided into 3 main files:

* `test/live_select/component_test.exs` - everything that can be tested by rendering the component statically
* `test/live_select_test.exs` - tests for `single` mode that require a running LiveView 
* `test/live_select_tags_test.exs` - tests for `tags` mode that require a running LiveView

Tests that require a LiveView use the showcase app as the parent LiveView.
